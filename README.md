# Real-Time Chat App with AI Moderation

## Overview
This is a real-time chat application built with Node.js, Next.js, JavaScript, React, and Socket.io. The app allows users to send and receive messages in real-time, with AI-powered moderation to filter out inappropriate content using the OpenAI API. Chat history is saved to a database for future reference.

## Features
- **Real-Time Messaging**: Users can send and receive messages instantly using WebSockets.
- **AI Moderation**: Messages are checked for inappropriate content using OpenAI's moderation API.
- **Chat History**: All messages are saved to a database for persistence.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A simple and intuitive UI built with React.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js (React, JavaScript)
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, Socket.io, JavaScript
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI API

## Getting Started
